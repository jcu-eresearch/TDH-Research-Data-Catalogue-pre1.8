About the Tropical Data Hub Research Data repository
====================================================

The Tropical Data Hub (TDH) Research Data repository aims to be an easy-to-use site that 
allows users to create records describing their research data: what it is, why it was created, 
who contributed to the datasets, where it is stored and how it can be used. This will enable 
JCU to build a profile of the research data and facilitate sharing and collaboration both within 
JCU and externally. 

Data Storage
------------
The TDH Research Data repository can be used to store publicly available data up to 50 MB in size
per data record. James Cook University can cater for research data storage in the 100s of TBs on other
systems. Please contact researchdata@jcu.edu.au to discuss your storage requirements.

TDH Research Data Repository and Research Data Australia
--------------------------------------------------------

The data descriptions, as well as records of the people and projects associated with the data  
are made publicly available and shared with Research Data Australia (RDA) regardless of 
whether the actual research data itself is made publicly available or not. Therefore 
confidential or sensitive information about the data should not be included in the metadata 
record.
