The Stage menu gives the number of records in each stage of the workflow; as a non-logged
in user, you will only see the count of published records.

The Source menu gives counts of the records imported from different sources - typically
these are from applications that generate new datasets and automatically create metadata
records for them. You can click on any of the entries in the Source menu to return the list of
all records from that source.

The Keywords menu provides counts of records associated with the various keywords in the
system. Keywords include the Fields of Research codes, Socio-Economic Objectives and
any local keywords. Clicking on an entry in the menu will perform a search for records that
contain that keyword.

The Results section lists the results of the search that has been performed. Clicking on to
the title of the record you are interested in will take you to its Details page.
