#Content
jcu-self-submission.field.help.dc-title=The title for the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. It is recommended for datasets and collections, the title should be unique to the data, ie. do not use the publication title as the data title.

#Coverage
jcu-self-submission.field.help.dc-coverage.vivo-DateTimeInterval=Use this to indicate a date range relevant to the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. Year format requires manual entry, eg. 1990 to 2010

jcu-self-submission.field.help.dc-coverage.vivo-GeographicLocation=<p> Geospatial location relevant to the research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. This may describe a geographical area where data was collected, a place which is the subject of a collection, or a location which is the focus of an activity, eg. coordinates or placename. </p> <p> You may use the map to select an area, or manually enter a correctly formatted set of coordinates or a value supported by a standard such as a country code, a URL pointing to an XML based description of spatial coverage or free text describing a location. </p> <p> If you wish to generate a map display in Research Data Australia, it is strongly advised that you use <b>DCMI Box</b> for shapes, or <b>DCMI Point</b> for points. </p> <p> Formats supported by the map widget: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml" target="_blank">GML</a> - OpenGIS Geography Markup Language (GML) Encoding Standard </li> <li> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/" target="_blank">KML</a> - Keyhole Markup Language developed for use with Google Earth </li> <li> <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-box" target="_blank">ISO19319dcmiBox</a> - DCMI Box notation derived from bounding box metadata conformant with the iso19139 schema </li> <li> <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-point" target="_blank">DCMIPoint</a> - spatial location information specified in DCMI Point notation </li> </ul> <p> When using the map to input shapes/points, only the above formats are supported. You can use the 'Find location' feature to pan the map to an area you are interested in, but you still need to select a map region to store geospatial data. </p> <p> Formats available for manual data entry: </p> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp" target="_blank">GPX</a> - the GPS Exchange Format </li> <li> <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists.htm" target="_blank">ISO3166</a> - ISO 3166-1 Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions - Part 1: Country codes </li> <li> <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country-codes/background_on_iso_3166/iso_3166-2.htm" target="_blank">ISO31662</a> - Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions - Part 2: Country subdivision codes </li> <li> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/" target="_blank">kmlPolyCoords</a> - A set of KML long/lat co-ordinates defining a polygon as described by the KML coordinates element </li> <li> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/" target="_blank">gmlKmlPolyCoords</a> - A set of KML long/lat co-ordinates derived from GML defining a polygon as described by the KML coordinates element but without the altitude component </li> <li> <strong>Text</strong> - free-text representation of spatial location. Use this to record place or region names where geospatial notation is not available. In ReDBox this will search against the Geonames database and return a latitude and longitude value if selected. This will store as a DCMIPoint which in future will display as a point on a Google Map in Research Data Australia. </li> </ul>
